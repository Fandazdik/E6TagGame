# E926TagGame
Pseudo e926 Hangman, you get pictures from the furry website e926.
They are shown one by one with each guess giving you another clue (in the form of another image) if you get it wrong.

Each of the images shown will have a tag (description word) associated with the image that will be shown above a text input box as (???\_????? e.g.) where underscores and spaces are automatically revealed to you.
